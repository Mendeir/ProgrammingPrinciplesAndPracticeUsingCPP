# Answers to Review, Drills and Exercises
Note: All non-programming questions will be listed here.

## Drills

> 1. Go to Appendix C and follow the steps required to set
 up a project. Set up an empty console C++ project called 
 hello_world.

> 2. Type in hello_world.cpp, exactly as specified below, 
 save it in your practice directory (folder), and include 
 it in your hello_world project.

[hello_world.cpp](hello_world.cpp)

> 3. Compile and run the “Hello, World!” program. Quite likely,
 something didn’t work quite right. It very rarely does in a 
 first attempt to use a new programming language or a new 
 programming environment. Find the problem and fix it! This is
 a point where asking for help from a more experienced person 
 is sensible, but be sure to understand what you are shown so 
 that you can do it all by yourself before proceeding further.

[hello_world.cpp](hello_world.cpp)

> 4. By now, you have probably encountered some errors and had to 
correct them. Now is the time to get a bit better acquainted 
with your compiler’s error-detection and error-reporting facilities!
Try the seven errors from §2.3 to see how your programming environment
 reacts. Think of at least five more errors you might have made typing
 in your program (e.g., forget keep_window_open(), leave the Caps Lock 
key on while typing a word, or type a comma instead of a semicolon) and 
try each to see what happens when you try to compile and run those versions.

## Review

> 1. What is the purpose of the “Hello, World!” program?

**Answer:** To be familiar with basic programming tools and be able to try 
your own programming environment. 

> 2. Name the four parts of a function.

**Answer:** A function has a **return type**, **function name**, **parameter list**,
and a **fucntion body**.

> 3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.

**Answer:** int main() {} must appear in every c++ program as this will be
the basis of the compiler on where to start executing.

> 4. In the “Hello, World!” program, what is the purpose of the line 
return 0;?

**Answer:** Its purpose is to inform the programmer whether program has been
successfully executed or not

> 5. What is the purpose of the compiler?

**Answer:** Its purpose is to translate source code into object code.

> 6. What is the purpose of the #include directive?

**Answer:** Its purpose is to instruct the computer to make available the 
facilities from a given file.

> 7. What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?

**Answer:** .h means that the file name is a header file

> 8. What does the linker do for your program?

**Answer:** It combines object files and libraries into an executable file.

> 9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?

**Answer:** A source file is a file containing the source code - produced by
the programmer and an ojbect file is a file containing the 
object code - output from compiler.

> 10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?

**Answer:** IDE's are usually an "All in one package" in which will do all 
the compilation and linking for you with just a click of a button. It does
automatic compilation and linking, syntax highlight, and many more depending
on the IDE that you will be using.

> 11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary
to practice? 

**Answer:** Practicing is neccessary because with theory alone you can't
learn on how to implement the different programming concepts. With practice,
you can learn on how to combine different programming concepts altogether and
their practical uses. 

## Exercises

> 1. Change the program to output the two lines
```C++
Hello, programming!
Here we go!
```

[Exercise 1.1.cpp](1.1.cpp)

> 2. Expanding on what you have learned, write a program 
that lists the instructions for a computer to find the 
upstairs bathroom, discussed in §2.1. Can you think of 
any more steps that a person would assume, but that a 
computer would not? Add them to your list. This is a
good start in “thinking like a computer.” Warning:
For most people, “go to the bathroom” is a perfectly 
adequate instruction. For someone with no experience 
with houses or bathrooms (imagine a stone-age person,
somehow transported into your dining room) the list of
necessary instructions could be very long. Please don’t 
use more than a page. For the benefit of the reader, 
you may add a short description of the layout of the 
house you are imagining.

[Exercise 1.2.cpp](1.2.cpp)

> 3. Write a description of how to get from the front 
door of your dorm room, apartment, house, whatever, 
to the door of your classroom (assuming you are
attending some school; if you are not, pick another 
target). Have a friend try to follow the instructions 
and annotate them with improvements as he or she goes 
along. To keep friends, it may be a good idea to “field 
test” those instructions before giving them to a friend.

> 4. Find a good cookbook. Read the instructions for 
baking blueberry muffins (if you are in a country
where “blueberry muffins” is a strange, exotic dish, 
use a more familiar dish instead). Please note that 
with a bit of help and instruction, most of the people
in the world can bake delicious blueberry muffins. 
It is not considered advanced or difficult fine cooking. 
However, for the author, few exercises in this book are 
as difficult as this one. It is amazing what you can 
do with a bit of practice.

> - Rewrite those instructions so that each individual 
action is in its own numbered paragraph. Be careful to 
list all ingredients and all kitchen utensils used at 
each step. Be careful about crucial details, such as the
 desired oven temperature, preheating the oven, the
 preparation of the muffin pan, the way to time the 
cooking, and the need to protect your hands when 
removing the muffins from the oven.

> - Consider those instructions from the point of view
of a cooking novice (if you are not one, get help from a
friend who does not know how to cook). Fill in the steps
that the book’s author (almost certainly an experienced 
cook) left out for being obvious.

> - Build a glossary of terms used. (What’s a muffin pan?
What does preheating do? What do you mean by “oven”?)

> - Now bake some muffins and enjoy your results.

None

> 5. Write a definition for each of the terms from 
“Terms.” First try to see if you can do it without 
looking at the chapter (not likely), then look through
the chapter to find definitions. You might find the 
difference between your first attempt and the book’s 
version interesting. You might consult some suitable 
online glossary, such as www.stroustrup.com/glossary.html.
By writing your own definition before looking it up, you
reinforce the learning you achieved through your reading.
If you have to reread a section to form a definition, 
that just helps you to understand. Feel free to use your
own words for the definitions, and make the definitions 
as detailed as you think reasonable. Often, an example 
after the main definition will be helpful. You may like 
to store the definitions in a file so that you can add to 
them from the “Terms” sections of later chapters.
