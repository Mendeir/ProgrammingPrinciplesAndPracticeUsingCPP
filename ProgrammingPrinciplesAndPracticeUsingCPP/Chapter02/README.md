# Answers to Review, Drills and Exercises
Note: All non-programming questions will be listed here.

## Drills

> 1. Go to Appendix C and follow the steps required to set
 up a project. Set up an empty console C++ project called 
 hello_world.

> 2. Type in hello_world.cpp, exactly as specified below, 
 save it in your practice directory (folder), and include 
 it in your hello_world project.

[hello_world.cpp](hello_world.cpp)

> 3. Compile and run the “Hello, World!” program. Quite likely,
 something didn’t work quite right. It very rarely does in a 
 first attempt to use a new programming language or a new 
 programming environment. Find the problem and fix it! This is
 a point where asking for help from a more experienced person 
 is sensible, but be sure to understand what you are shown so 
 that you can do it all by yourself before proceeding further.

[hello_world.cpp](hello_world.cpp)

> 4. By now, you have probably encountered some errors and had to 
correct them. Now is the time to get a bit better acquainted 
with your compiler’s error-detection and error-reporting facilities!
Try the seven errors from §2.3 to see how your programming environment
 reacts. Think of at least five more errors you might have made typing
 in your program (e.g., forget keep_window_open(), leave the Caps Lock 
key on while typing a word, or type a comma instead of a semicolon) and 
try each to see what happens when you try to compile and run those versions.

## Review

> 1. What is the purpose of the “Hello, World!” program?

**Answer:** To be familiar with basic programming tools and be able to try 
your own programming environment. 

> 2. Name the four parts of a function.

**Answer:** A function has a **return type**, **function name**, **parameter list**,
and a **fucntion body**.

> 3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.

**Answer:** int main() {} must appear in every c++ program as this will be
the basis of the compiler on where to start executing.

> 4. In the “Hello, World!” program, what is the purpose of the line 
return 0;?

**Answer:** Its purpose is to inform the programmer whether program has been
successfully executed or not

> 5. What is the purpose of the compiler?

**Answer:** Its purpose is to translate source code into object code.

> 6. What is the purpose of the #include directive?

**Answer:** Its purpose is to instruct the computer to make available the 
facilities from a given file.

> 7. What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?

**Answer:** .h means that the file name is a header file

> 8. What does the linker do for your program?

**Answer:** It combines object files and libraries into an executable file.

> 9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?

**Answer:** A source file is a file containing the source code - produced by
the programmer and an ojbect file is a file containing the 
object code - output from compiler.

> 10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?

**Answer:** IDE's are usually an "All in one package" in which will do all 
the compilation and linking for you with just a click of a button. It does
automatic compilation and linking, syntax highlight, and many more depending
on the IDE that you will be using.

> 11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary
to practice? 

**Answer:** Practicing is neccessary because with theory alone you can't
learn on how to implement the different programming concepts. With practice,
you can learn on how to combine different programming concepts altogether and
their practical uses.
